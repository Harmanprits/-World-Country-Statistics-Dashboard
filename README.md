# World Country Statistics Dashboard

## Introduction
The dataset contains information about the population, land area, population density, water area, GDP, GDP growth rate, and the share of world GDP for various countries. Each row represents a different country, with corresponding values for these key indicators. This data offers insights into the demographic, economic, and geographical characteristics of nations across different continents and regions. Analyzing this dataset can help identify trends, disparities, and patterns in population distribution, economic development, and land-water resource allocation worldwide.

## Project Overview
- **Domain:** World Datasheet Analytics
- **Project Name:** World Data Analyst
- **Dataset Type:** Excel Data
